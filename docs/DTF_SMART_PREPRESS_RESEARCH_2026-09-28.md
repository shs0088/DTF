# DTF Smart Prep Studio — Research & Architecture Baseline

Date: 2026-09-28
Branch: chatgpt/dtf-smart-prepress-20260928
Status: Research-backed implementation baseline. Not deployed.

## Objective

Create a semi-automatic DTF image-preparation tool that is launched from the storefront's existing Print Your Dream path, performs heavy work server-side, preserves browser responsiveness, produces separate display/mockup/print artifacts, and integrates cleanly with the existing mockup workflow.

The tool must NOT become a printer RIP. Final printer-specific CMYK/white-channel driving, ICC linearization and device control remain the responsibility of the RIP.

## Research scope

A broad web sweep was performed across more than 100 targeted search queries covering DTF/DTG RIP systems, prepress/preflight software, background-removal systems, vectorization/upscaling tools, image-processing libraries, color management, halftoning algorithms, mockup APIs, POD APIs, upload security and asynchronous processing architectures.

Priority was given to official documentation, public API references, vendor help systems and maintained open-source repositories rather than marketing listicles.

## Findings

### 1. Separate analysis from fixing

Professional preflight products do not reduce readiness to one score. They expose exact errors/warnings and the data that caused them.

DTF Smart Prep must therefore store:
- real file signature and normalized MIME
- pixel dimensions
- embedded DPI when present
- effective DPI per selected product print area
- physical print size
- alpha/transparency statistics
- scaling/enlargement risk
- previewability
- format-specific constraints
- product compatibility
- rule/version used
- timestamp
- exact warning/error codes

A fix may never silently erase the original preflight evidence.

### 2. Alpha is the key DTF object

Background removal is not just binary deletion. Good systems preserve a non-binary alpha matte so hair, smoke, glow, anti-aliased edges and soft gradients remain usable.

Pipeline rule:
- preserve original RGB + source alpha
- derive an editable alpha matte
- refine alpha edges
- decontaminate edge color when the removed background polluted RGB
- avoid converting all semi-transparent pixels to opaque
- keep an undoable version chain

### 3. White-underbase logic is derived from alpha, not from a white rectangle

Research across DTF RIP systems consistently shows:
- underbase may be generated from artwork coverage/alpha
- white density can be adaptive to pixel opacity or color
- choke contracts the white mask inward to prevent white peeking/halo
- highlight white and underbase white are separate concepts in advanced workflows

DTF Smart Prep should PREVIEW a white-underbase channel and choke. It should not pretend to drive printer white ink directly.

### 4. Halftone must be optional and measurable

Halftone is valuable for:
- smoke/glow/translucency on dark garments
- reducing heavy solid ink areas
- simulating softer hand / garment blending

It is not appropriate for every design.

Controls to expose:
- screening mode
- frequency / nominal LPI
- angle
- dot/shape family
- threshold/levels
- alpha-driven hole sizing
- preview on dark/light garment

Safe first implementation can use deterministic ordered/clustered-dot screening. More advanced AM/FM or stochastic screening can be added later.

### 5. Effective DPI matters more than metadata DPI

A PNG can contain physical-density metadata, but embedded DPI alone cannot make a low-resolution image printable.

Effective DPI must be calculated from:
pixel dimensions / intended physical print dimensions.

The same source may PASS for a mug and FAIL for a large hoodie placement.

### 6. Upscaling must be advisory

AI upscaling can increase pixel count, but must never be presented as restoring real detail with certainty.

Policy:
- compute required scale
- if enlargement is modest, offer high-quality resampling
- if enlargement is significant, offer optional AI upscale
- keep original and record the operation
- re-run preflight on output
- require user approval if the visual appearance changes materially

### 7. Vectorization is useful only for the right artwork

Logos, flat illustrations and line art can benefit from vector tracing. Photographs generally should not be auto-vectorized.

The system should classify likely line-art / flat-color candidates and OFFER vectorization, never force it.

### 8. Mockup compatibility must be a first-class contract

Mockup engines generally need:
- an artwork asset URL or binary
- a product/template identifier
- a printable area / smart-object identifier
- transform information

DTF Smart Prep should produce a stable Mockup Asset Contract independent of any one provider.

Required fields:
- assetId
- processedVersionId
- sourceHash
- processedHash
- transparentAssetUrl
- webPreviewUrl
- widthPx
- heightPx
- physicalWidthIn / physicalHeightIn
- productType / productId / variantId
- placement
- printAreaId
- normalized positionX / positionY
- scale
- rotation
- flip
- safe-area status
- preflight status
- processing recipe/version

This contract can feed:
- existing local MockupRenderer
- Printify product/mockup data
- Printful mockup generation
- Dynamic Mockups / PSD smart objects
- future providers

### 9. Do not use the print master as the storefront image

Store distinct artifacts:
1. Original Source
2. Working/Processed Master candidate
3. Approved Ready-to-Print Master
4. Display Image
5. Mockup Asset
6. Web Thumbnail
7. Preflight JSON
8. White-underbase preview
9. Optional halftone variant

The web page should use optimized display assets. The print master should remain private and high resolution.

### 10. Browser performance architecture

The browser should:
- validate basic file size/type hints
- create only a small local preview when safe
- upload using streaming/multipart
- subscribe/poll job status
- render small preview outputs
- never run heavyweight segmentation/upscaling on the main UI thread

The server should:
- verify signature
- enforce pixel/decompression limits
- persist original
- enqueue heavy work
- perform image processing
- store versioned outputs
- return status/progress

Recommended image engine for deterministic raster operations: Sharp/libvips because of low memory usage and demand-driven processing.

Recommended queue abstraction:
- production: Redis/BullMQ or equivalent
- fallback/demo: durable database/job table with strict state transitions

### 11. Security

Required:
- real signature validation, not extension trust
- MIME/signature match checks
- maximum compressed size
- maximum decoded pixel count
- SVG sanitization or rasterization in isolated worker
- PDF page/complexity limits
- reject malformed/decompression-bomb inputs
- safe generated storage keys
- do not execute embedded scripts
- strip unnecessary metadata from web previews
- keep source files private
- provider API keys server-side only
- audit every destructive or AI-changing operation

### 12. Semi-automatic policy

AUTO (safe/deterministic):
- inspect
- compute effective DPI
- transparent-bounds crop suggestion
- generate web preview
- generate dark/light background previews
- detect likely halo / background / scaling risks
- produce underbase preview
- build mockup metadata

ASK / APPROVAL REQUIRED:
- background removal when confidence is not high
- edge color decontamination if appearance may change
- strong contrast/color changes
- AI upscale
- AI retouch
- vectorization
- halftone replacing the normal master
- destructive crop outside transparent-only bounds

### 13. Product-fit must be dynamic

Do not hard-code only seven combinations.

Each product model should provide:
- placement IDs
- printable width/height
- safe margin
- min effective DPI
- alpha requirement/allowance
- allowed formats
- optional maximum ink/coverage guidance
- mockup template mapping

The same prepress engine then evaluates any current or future product.

- Print master remains private.
- Web/display derivatives are optimized.
- No external provider secret is exposed.
- Arabic/English and RTL/LTR are supported.
- Existing protected Home card sizing/navigation behavior is not altered.
- No deployment or main merge without CI + runtime validation.
